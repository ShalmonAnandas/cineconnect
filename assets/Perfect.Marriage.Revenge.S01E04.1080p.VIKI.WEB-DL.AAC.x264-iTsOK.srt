[Episode 4]

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,230
Thank you for coming all the way out here.

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,490
No problem. It's quiet out here, very nice.

6
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,580
If we meet somewhere crowded,
there will be strange rumors.

7
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,350
We thought a more humble
setting like this might be better.

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,330
Actually, I don't understand.

9
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,540
If you wanted to take in our
child as your daughter-in-law,

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,490
you wouldn't treat us like this.

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
- Honey, how could you be so rude?
- No.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,380
You understand what's going on. Seems like
you're the actual big shot of the Hanwool Group.

13
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,810
I'm Cha Yeon Hwa.

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,810
I'm Lee Jung Hye.

15
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,150
Are we all here, then?

16
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,000
Our daughter is on her way...

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,950
There she is.

18
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,130
Honey.

19
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,140
Jae Ho, I told you not to have her drive!

20
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,790
Dad, please!

21
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,930
I'm sorry, Father...

22
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,640
Hello!

23
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,630
Our other daughter is not feeling
well today and couldn't make it.

24
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,800
Our eldest son is also busy with
the redevelopment project, so...

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
Yes.

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,300
I know Taeja Group is
taking on a big project.

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,590
Yet, you still make the time
to work on the foundation.

28
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,230
I've heard a lot about the
Generous Person Foundation.

29
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,340
You let struggling single mothers and their
children live here, help them get on their feet.

30
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,080
The nuns and teachers do all the hard work.

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,350
All we do is pay for it.

32
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,390
That is an incredible thing.

33
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,750
That must not be easy for a businessperson.

34
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,640
Foundations just bleed
money the longer you do it.

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,630
That's why I'm a total
failure as a businesswoman.

36
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,050
I'm learning a lot today.

37
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,400
Seeing how the Taeja
Group could be so humble...

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,370
and seeing you be so informal
makes me look back on myself.

39
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,380
Earlier, you said if we really
wanted to take in your daughter,

40
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,020
we wouldn't be treating you like this.

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,790
I misspoke for a moment, being
disappointed on behalf of my daughter.

42
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,980
But I get it.

43
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,480
Any prestigious family would die for their
child to be Taeja Group's daughter-in-law.

44
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,790
We're not that shallow.

45
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,240
- If they like each other, we-
- But...

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,070
you must know that our daughter is adopted.

47
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,020
So what?

48
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,570
That's not Han Yi Joo's fault, is it?

49
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,480
If everyone thought like
you, how great would it be?

50
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,620
But in reality, people
talk behind your back.

51
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,690
"She's adopted. That's why she's
like that. She was taught wrong."

52
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,060
I worked extra hard not to
hear things like that, but...

53
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,070
She studied art and graduated from college,
but she doesn't know how to do anything yet.

54
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,830
She hasn't sold any pieces,
and she's not good at housework.

55
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,210
After marrying her off, I
worry what people will say.

56
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,210
What the heck? Did they
show up to ruin the marriage?

57
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,230
- Should we do cheers?
- For what?

58
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,320
If you're saying that out
of true concern for us...

59
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,640
you don't need to worry.

60
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,200
Han Yi Joo is a great
person. If she wasn't,

61
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,520
I would not have wanted to marry her.

62
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,730
Yi Joo. Do you feel the same?

63
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm curious if you think you're qualified
to be the Taeja Group's daughter-in-law.

64
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,010
You're right, Mother.

65
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,060
I'm inadequate.

66
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,860
Like you said, I'm not good enough, but...

67
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,800
for the occasion, I brought a gift.

68
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,950
Could I show it to you?

69
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,930
A gift? What is it?

70
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,700
You painted this, Yi Joo?

71
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,570
I feel like I've seen it before.

72
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,460
I copied a painting by the
famous artist Edward Boir.

73
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,770
You could call it...

74
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,360
a fake.

75
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,090
Actually, my mother does
some very unique charity work.

76
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,400
She makes exact copies of famous paintings
to hang at welfare centers or public spaces.

77
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,290
For people who can't easily go to a museum.

78
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,130
I thought maybe the Generous Person Foundation
could hang it, so I thought I'd bring it.

79
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,470
Oh, my, how thoughtful of you!

80
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,710
Aigoo, thank you so much for this!

81
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,290
Hey, go hang this painting somewhere.

82
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,370
Where would be good?

83
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,380
Yes, there! How about right there?

84
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,220
Go ahead and put it up.

85
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,950
Yi Joo.

86
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,200
Could we talk for a second?

87
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,490
How did you get that painting?

88
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,190
I know it must be strange.

89
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,040
You hand-delivered that piece
to the lady from Jaeil Group.

90
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,510
How did you...

91
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:28,110
Among the VIP clients, she is
a fan of French intimism, no?

92
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,490
I saw she had moved up a tier recently.

93
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,950
That means she purchased
a pretty expensive piece.

94
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,860
I told her there was an
issue during transport.

95
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,650
I offered to refund her
immediately, and she gave it back.

96
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,500
Nonsense.

97
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,430
It's worth one billion.
How did you pay that back?

98
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,250
If you don't believe me,
why don't you check with her?

99
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,400
Ma'am? It's Lee Jung Hye.

100
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,780
The piece you purchased...

101
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,640
Hey, CEO Lee. I got the money.

102
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,230
- What?
- Yi Joo is so good at her job.

103
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,900
I'll be back at the gallery
to see other pieces soon.

104
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,260
I'm shopping now, so...

105
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,100
I got the paperwork back, too.

106
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,380
Here's your signature, Mother.

107
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,050
Guaranteeing its authenticity.

108
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,030
You really want to go at it with me?

109
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,420
- Are you out of your mind?
- Yes.

110
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,070
I am.

111
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,370
I'm going through with this
marriage, no matter what.

112
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,560
- Han Yi Joo...
- And while I'm at it, I'll do it right.

113
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,490
Wearing the most expensive
dress at an extravagant venue,

114
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,010
with Yoo Ra, Mother...

115
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,440
Father, Grandfather, all there to bless us.

116
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,810
So, Mother...

117
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,970
wrap up the family
introduction nicely today.

118
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,640
Stop trying to provoke me.

119
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,140
It was great to meet you today.

120
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,370
Safe travels home.

121
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,960
I'll come by and visit
you soon, Chairwoman.

122
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,100
- I'll have things to discuss with you.
- Sounds good.

123
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,570
Your eyes are about to pop out. Let's go.

124
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,880
So, are you proud of yourself?

125
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,610
For acting like you wanted to
ruin your daughter's marriage?

126
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,530
Why are you only mad at me?

127
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,680
Didn't you hear that woman run her mouth?

128
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,230
It's Taeja Group!

129
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,300
Of course, they're going to act superior.

130
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,650
You need to think about our
company as part of the Hanwool Group!

131
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,100
I'm a mother before that.

132
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,000
- And you're Yoo Ra's father before a CEO.
- No.

133
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,550
I was always a CEO first.
You brought along the kid.

134
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,430
You brought along the kid.

135
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,760
Honey!

136
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,890
Aren't you managing the gallery?

137
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,070
You had no idea what Han Yi Joo was doing?

138
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,070
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,120
Get it together.

140
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,070
Where are you going so late?

141
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,430
How was the meeting?

142
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,500
- Well...
- You couldn't...

143
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,700
break it up, huh?

144
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,470
We just said hello.

145
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,910
Nothing is moving forward-

146
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,250
Yoo Ra!

147
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,930
Yoo Ra.

148
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,590
Yoo Ra.

149
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,970
This is about Seo Do Guk, huh?

150
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,260
I'll talk to Yi Joo about it.

151
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,670
She must have thought more about it, too.

152
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,580
Stop. You've had enough.

153
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,100
Do you even know what Unni was doing today?

154
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,750
They had a family introduction today.

155
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,470
Family introduction...

156
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,850
What?

157
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,070
While you're just standing around,

158
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,460
the marriage is right on track.

159
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,620
That's ridiculous.

160
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,250
Where is Yi Joo right now, huh?

161
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,490
I don't know. She could be
at a hotel or Seo Do Guk's.

162
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,710
A family introduction...

163
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,600
Se Hyeok, do you even want to get her back?

164
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,680
Of course.

165
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,980
But I don't know how...

166
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,190
Then help me.

167
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,520
What?

168
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,760
I'm going to take matters
into my own hands.

169
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,890
Grandma.

170
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,690
Madam Cha, why so moody?

171
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,030
Do Na, what did you think?

172
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,790
- Of what?
- The family of the girl who wants to marry Do Guk.

173
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,170
What did you think?

174
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,140
Her mom is like a more evil
version of Cinderella's stepmom.

175
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,380
You saw her pretending to be nice
while putting down her daughter, right?

176
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,130
I know!

177
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,560
Accusing us of not having manners?

178
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,290
They put down their own child
in front of us for being adopted.

179
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,000
- Isn't that child abuse?
- She hasn't been a child for about 20 years.

180
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,140
They probably treated her
like that since childhood!

181
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,670
Do you think they even fed her
well? That's why she's so skinny.

182
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,030
What? What's wrong?

183
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,480
My goodness, Madam Cha.

184
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,910
Has she stolen your heart already?

185
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,000
Stolen? What do you mean?

186
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,210
I just feel bad for her.

187
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,700
Pity is something you
should feel for a stray cat.

188
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,020
- Not a daughter-in-law.
- Mother. I don't...

189
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,610
Mother. I don't...

190
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,600
Gosh, this is all irrelevant.

191
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,950
We could sit here and talk
forever. Do Guk doesn't care.

192
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,830
He seems totally crazy about her.

193
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,770
What? Crazy about her?

194
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,340
Girl, don't talk about
your brother like that.

195
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,360
Has Do Na ever treated us
like older brothers anyway?

196
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,690
- Hey, Oppa.
- Hey, Jung Wook.

197
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,080
Yes, Grandmother.

198
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,530
Do Na, did you quit your
job? You're always home.

199
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,430
What? Everyone works from
home these days. Don't you know?

200
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,950
I guess not. I tend to
spend day and night at work.

201
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,970
By the way, how did it go with
the family introduction for Do Guk?

202
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,320
Well, the girl seems all right.

203
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,780
But her mom...

204
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,310
I don't like her.

205
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,300
Really? How so?

206
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,580
Well, she's just so-so.

207
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,430
Anyway, you're fine with it, right?

208
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,780
- We'll see.
- What? I thought you liked her.

209
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,240
You really connected
with that girl, didn't you?

210
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,630
What connection?

211
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,400
I saw everything.

212
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,560
You two were exchanging eye contact like...

213
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,340
What are you talking about?

214
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,050
If you're going to talk
nonsense, get out. Go home!

215
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,990
So? How did you get my aunt's blessing?

216
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,020
What?

217
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,200
I somehow knew you two would get along.

218
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,990
How did that picky aunt take one look
at you and agree to meet your family?

219
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,700
It's nothing. I just...

220
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,260
Let's do it. A family
introduction. With everyone.

221
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,480
What?

222
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,220
Under one condition.

223
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,800
Can you keep a secret from Do Guk?

224
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,820
Yes. Please tell me.

225
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,570
I'll give you six months.

226
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,910
Convince Do Guk to go back to Taeja Group.

227
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,590
Then, we'll accept you.

228
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,350
If you can't, I hope you walk
away on your own, Han Yi Joo.

229
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,640
Will that be difficult?

230
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,420
No. I'll do as you say.

231
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,920
Do you think Seo Do Guk might
want to go back to Taeja Group?

232
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,590
Why? Is there talk?

233
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,850
No, I'm just curious.

234
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,650
That probably won't happen.

235
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,820
His grandmother chose him first as a successor,
but he left to start his own company.

236
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,220
He wouldn't come back, at
least for Jung Wook's sake.

237
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,400
Jung Wook?

238
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,470
You mean Do Guk's older brother?

239
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,240
Oh, yeah.

240
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,740
What? Are they not on good terms?

241
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,400
I mean, I don't really know about that.

242
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,750
Too hot!

243
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,300
Excuse me, can I get some ice water?

244
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,860
Coming!

245
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,660
This is way too hot.

246
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,600
We don't really have a
house party culture in Korea.

247
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,160
Unless you're really close, you
don't really go to someone's home.

248
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,910
So, approaches like our "online
homes" have been more popular.

249
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,480
That's why I'm saying let's go to
Japan first since they're similar.

250
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,710
I know it is, but...

251
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,940
going abroad creates
issues for hiring, supply...

252
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,260
It's something we need
to confront eventually.

253
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,070
There will never be a "perfect
time" to start something.

254
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,560
We should get ahead when it feels early.

255
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,580
Shouldn't you be working on the
Taeja Constructions project first?

256
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,580
Of course.

257
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,440
But is that all I should be doing?
Not prepare for the next one?

258
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,850
Of course, we should. But
through discussion and agreement.

259
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,760
We can't just start a project just
because you want to, CEO Seo.

260
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,690
We're not a mom-and-pop shop.

261
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,630
Mr. Yoo, those were some strong words...

262
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,290
If I can't run my company the way I want,

263
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,290
why should I be the CEO?

264
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,440
I'd rather run a mom-and-pop shop.

265
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,220
CEO Seo, that'd be pulling too much weight.

266
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,740
So...

267
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,350
are you doubting your employees' judgment?

268
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,650
Yeah, especially yours, Mr. Yoo.

269
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,130
You can't even tell if she's
a good woman or not...

270
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,130
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

271
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,840
Deputy CEO, I have
something urgent to tell you.

272
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,050
What? Now?

273
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,060
Yes, let's step outside and talk.

274
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,300
- Let's get some kimchi stew.
- K-Kimchi stew?

275
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,890
Stop making excuses about work
and say what you want to say, Mr. Yoo.

276
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,140
CEO Seo, I've worked for you for the
past five years, always doing my best.

277
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,160
And now you lust over
your subordinate's fiancée.

278
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,590
Don't you think you've gone too far?

279
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,200
I'm pretty sure I got there
after you were dumped, Mr. Yoo.

280
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,530
No. Yi Joo and I were taking
a break to think about things.

281
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,020
Yi Joo thought about it
and made her decision.

282
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,430
She wants to marry me.

283
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,680
She doesn't mean it.

284
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,030
Did you really know her that well?

285
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,700
I know how much and
how long Yi Joo liked me.

286
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,100
I know how upset she is, so I'm trying
to understand where she's coming from.

287
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,560
I'm sorry that you're being used, CEO Seo.

288
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,250
I don't care.

289
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,170
What?

290
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:46,650
I'm so in love that I will gladly be used.

291
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:52,430
I despise her pretty name
coming out of another man's mouth.

292
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,040
I could rip out your tongue right now.

293
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,000
That's love, right?

294
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,150
CEO Seo, what are you
going to do to Yi Joo?

295
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,960
What do you mean? I'll do
my duty as her life partner.

296
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,360
Love her, trust her, stand by her side.

297
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,370
So that she can do what
she truly wants to do.

298
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,870
You'll refund all of them?

299
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,760
All the fake pieces that Yi Joo made?

300
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,300
Say there was an issue while
tracking the ownership history.

301
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,030
Refund everything exactly
and get the pieces back.

302
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,740
Wipe the transaction history clean.

303
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,550
For the costs...

304
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,890
use the Malaysia account.

305
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,640
Did someone notice?

306
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,160
No one called the gallery...

307
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,840
All the authenticators
said they were perfect, too.

308
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,950
Do what I tell you to. Don't argue with me.

309
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,700
Yes, CEO Lee.

310
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,590
And the madam from Jaeil Group is here.

311
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,840
Hello, Ma'am.

312
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,590
Hi, CEO Lee.

313
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,550
I apologize for causing concern recently.

314
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,710
Oh, it's all right. It happens.

315
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,490
Were there any issues with the refund?

316
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,870
Of course not. She actually asked
me first if I had a non-taxable account.

317
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,790
I was surprised she offered
to send it there directly.

318
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,860
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

319
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,010
Thanks to that, I got
every single penny back.

320
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:10,230
Ma'am, I need a little favor.

321
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:15,550
I think the Hanwool employee used a
different account than the gallery uses.

322
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,210
Could you check for me who the sender was?

323
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,350
Of course.

324
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,580
[Seo Do Guk]

325
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,770
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

326
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,160
How about you? What are you doing?

327
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,820
I'm at work. I think I'm
pulling an all-nighter.

328
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,800
Or I might go to a hotel at dawn.

329
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,720
Why don't you go home?

330
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,750
I like hotels.

331
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,780
Want to come, Han Yi Joo?

332
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,810
I'm busy. I'm packing.

333
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,510
You're moving out today?

334
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,550
Want a ride?

335
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,920
No thanks, I'll call a taxi.

336
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,670
Don't do it alone.

337
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,800
What?

338
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,320
I'll always be by your side.

339
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,390
You don't have to try
to do everything alone.

340
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,260
Don't treat me like a kid.

341
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,140
If something actually difficult
comes up, I'll let you know.

342
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,260
I'm proud of you, Yi Joo.

343
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,630
You said you were busy.
Sounds like you're bored.

344
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,600
No, I need to work hard to feed Han Yi Joo.

345
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
Then, work harder.

346
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,790
Bye.

347
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,100
Typical.

348
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,880
What are you doing?

349
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,590
You're going to CEO
Seo's, right? I'll drive you.

350
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,870
No thanks, I'll go.

351
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,210
I know the way. I need to talk to you, too.

352
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,950
I said no. Se Hyeok, what are you doing?

353
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,690
Please let me do this.
It might be the last time.

354
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,460
- I'll put them inside.
- No thanks.

355
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,400
- Please leave.
- Yi Joo.

356
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,600
- Did you only think of me as your lover?
- What?

357
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,550
So if that part of our relationship
is over, we're strangers?

358
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:02,960
We were childhood friends who had no
one but each other in our neighborhood.

359
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,350
Are you blaming me right now?

360
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,190
- Don't you get how we got here?
- I know it was my fault.

361
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,340
That's why I can't be mad that you're
marrying another man right away.

362
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,880
Even if...

363
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,380
Even if this is it for us, I
will wish you happiness.

364
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,980
As your friend who cares about you.

365
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,510
What is it that you want to say?

366
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,510
I wouldn't be like this
for any other guy. But...

367
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,500
Seo Do Guk is not it.

368
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,080
He just met you, and now he's
proposing, meeting your family...

369
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,560
and having you move in?

370
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,600
The people who know Seo Do Guk would
never believe this. That it's nonsense.

371
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,130
That must be how passionate he is for me.

372
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,910
- What?
- When men are in love, they can't see anything else.

373
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:49,270
Like you, wanting to be close to the one you
love, you were going to marry her sister.

374
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,710
Am I wrong?

375
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,400
I...

376
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,360
I asked him...

377
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,020
if he knew my relationship with you.

378
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,470
I said we were friends and lovers for 20
years in our neighborhood, and he didn't care.

379
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,380
He doesn't want to know.

380
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,950
Is that something a man in love would say?

381
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,950
Seo Do Guk is cool about it.

382
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,640
Unlike pathetic you-know-who.

383
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,950
That's not being cool. It's apathy.

384
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:27,150
Yi Joo. I'm not just
doing this for no reason.

385
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,600
Seo Do Guk is a scary person.

386
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,460
For sure, he has some ulterior motive.

387
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,400
Do you know that CEO
Seo tried to kill someone?

388
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,310
- What?
- He pushed his own brother off a boat.

389
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,960
And from that incident,
his brother was disabled.

390
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,680
The reason CEO Seo left
Taeja Group was because

391
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,200
he didn't want to fight
over the successor position.

392
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,780
Why? Because what he
did would come to light again.

393
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,310
You must be in shock. I'm sorry.

394
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:21,050
Who else is going to tell you this but me?

395
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,370
Who else cares about you
as much as I do, Yi Joo?

396
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,240
So, come back to me.

397
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,640
And let's try again-

398
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,370
Get away from me.

399
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,850
Oppa.

400
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,420
You should be an actor.

401
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,810
Where did you hear that?

402
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,580
You told me yourself.

403
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,630
Seo Do Guk and his
brother are not on good terms.

404
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:45,000
Is it true that Seo Do Guk
pushed his brother off a boat?

405
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,700
- Is it?
- I don't know for sure.

406
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,990
It's true that Jung Wook fell over the railing
and got hurt badly while they were alone.

407
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,210
But it could've just been an accident.

408
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,230
Jung Wook said his brother pushed him.

409
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,210
There's a witness who
gave a similar testimony.

410
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,560
Anyway, no one in my
family brings that up since.

411
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,150
Everyone just wants to forget about it.

412
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,310
Do you think that's enough?

413
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,150
Didn't you see Han Yi Joo in shock?

414
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,650
She was frozen like a rock.

415
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,790
So they burn for each other, I see.

416
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,950
Just wait and see.

417
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,200
When the trust breaks,
they'll be on shaky ground.

[Taeja Constructions Seo Jung Wook]

419
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,200
[Deputy CEO Seo Jung Wook Donates
Large Sum to Disability Organization]

420
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,460
Sunbae!

421
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,840
I mean, CEO Seo! Emergency.

422
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,770
The Deputy CEO of Taeja Constructions...

423
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,920
So... Seo Jung Wook...

424
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,200
What did Seo Jung Wook do?

425
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,340
He made a mess.

426
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,540
Cancel? What do you mean?

427
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,560
You wanted to do this first.

428
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,670
I know.

429
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,490
But you're responsible, too.

430
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,600
- What?
- Since the news of your wedding,

431
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,790
there have been talks of
Hanwool and Taeja Group linking.

432
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:07,770
But Hanwool's reputation
isn't that great, you know.

433
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,310
The union is up in arms, saying
it ruins our building's brand.

434
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,420
I'll tell Grandmother myself.

435
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,020
I don't want her to think there's
some kind of internal division.

436
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,350
I have a general meeting, so...

437
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,350
This was decided before they
were selected as the constructors.

438
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,100
Why pull out now?

439
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,780
Did he get approval from the union members?

440
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,280
They're about to hold a general meeting
for the changes in the construction plan.

441
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,650
They'll probably write it on the
back of the agreement in fine print.

442
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,620
This is a huge project!

443
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,220
Even for Taeja Constructions,
a trillion-won project is rare.

444
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,890
We brought in so many companies for this.

445
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,120
Is there a solution, huh?

446
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,630
I think it'll be challenging.

447
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,660
It seems like a warning that they
don't wish to associate with Hanwool.

448
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,020
What?

449
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,230
Hanwool Financials is notorious
in the construction business.

450
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,750
They previously acquired Dongmi Constructions,
which was near bankruptcy, for over 100 billion.

451
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:24,450
Then, they embezzled the money and bankrupted
a company that could have bounced back.

452
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,220
So, my upcoming wedding is the issue.

453
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,080
It's between Han Yi Joo and me, not
between our company and Hanwool.

454
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,720
Taeja Constructions is even more removed.

455
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,160
Not so sure about that. If someone
made up a rumor in the dark,

456
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,920
it'll be hard to tell who
started it or how far it'll spread.

457
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,230
Then, we can bring it out into the light.

458
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,800
- Excuse me?
- What?

459
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,600
Why are you illegally changing the design plans?
[Noblesse Amitier Redevelopment Union Meeting]

460
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,810
Please rescind!

461
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:12,320
This is the agenda for today's meeting.
[Noblesse Amitier Redevelopment Union Meeting]

462
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,870
First, questions on the
contracted employee activity.

463
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:24,600
And the increase in construction
costs due to the change in design...

464
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,690
I will explain myself.

465
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,220
Vice President...

466
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,580
This is Taeja Construction's
Vice President, Seo Jung Wook.

467
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,170
These ladies who are hired as "advertisers"
go around knocking on senior citizens' doors,

468
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:47,390
telling them the design change
is confirmed! Isn't that illegal?

469
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,700
That was an unauthorized
strategy by our contractor company.

470
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,010
If there is an issue,
they will be responsible.

471
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,610
What about the change in design?

472
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,720
A 200-billion won increase in the
construction costs? How does that make sense?

473
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,530
This makes no sense!

474
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,690
We're going to make it make sense.

475
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,370
The cost didn't just randomly go up.

476
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,780
It's simply because we
expanded the entire site.

477
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,680
The benefit from that will go
right back to you, the residents.

478
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,770
How can you do that?

479
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,170
Of course, I understand
your anxieties completely.

480
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:26,230
So I, Seo Jung Wook,
promise you this one thing.

481
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,230
Everyone.

482
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,200
Isn't money what you all want the most?

483
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,180
In this district, we will make this complex

484
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,240
the most expensive property
in this country, minus Gangnam.

485
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,230
- I promise you.
- Now, now.

486
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,870
The Vice President gives you
his word. A round of applause.

487
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,860
But you still need to verify.

488
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,070
As you said earlier, it's a big project.

489
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,690
There can't be any mistakes.

490
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,230
But what I don't understand is...

491
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:26,480
the area that actually contributed to the
expansion is just the underground parking lot.

492
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,930
Why was the budget based
on the area above ground?

493
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,070
It's a trifold difference.

494
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,380
I think there's been a
mistake in the calculations.

495
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,860
Why don't you take a look
at it again? Take your time.

496
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,880
What happened, Manager Park?

497
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,080
- Yes?
- The design.

498
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,720
Did you upload the final version?

499
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:03,020
I-I'll look over it again with the design
team and make an announcement.

500
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,580
But he is...

501
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,650
Me?

502
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,700
Excuse me for a moment.

503
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,440
Allow me to introduce myself.

504
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,970
For the upcoming
reconstruction of Noblesse Amitier,

505
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,050
I will be collaborating with Taeja
Constructions to provide custom concepts.

506
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,430
I am CEO Seo Do Guk of
H-Terier, an interior design platform.

507
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:31,410
H-Terier? I've heard of it.

508
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,860
They're famous. I've seen them on the news.

509
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,680
Oh, yes. I saw them on the news.

510
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,270
That's right.

511
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,720
As VP Seo Jung Wook just said,

512
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,710
we cannot separate money from
the worth of an apartment building.

513
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:53,620
But another important issue is elevating
the quality of life of those who live there.

514
00:39:53,620 --> 00:40:00,630
Thus, our company will work with the residents'
unique preferences and lifestyles to provide

515
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:06,630
interior concepts, supply selections, and even
floor plans to follow along and support you.

516
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:13,550
Just like how I corrected Taeja
Construction's mistake just now.

517
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,510
But regarding my upcoming wedding,

518
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:25,590
I hear there are talks of excluding my company
from this project due to a very private matter.

519
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,370
Since we're all gathered here,
could I ask for your thoughts?

520
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:35,380
As for that, when will we do the
paperwork and put it to a vote?

521
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,260
How about a show of hands?

522
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,060
Those members who wish to
create great living spaces with us,

523
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,680
please raise your hands.

524
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,660
Do Guk went all the way
over there because of him?

525
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,250
I see. Thanks, Secretary Jang.

526
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:42,620
First, I would like to
apologize to you, Chairwoman.

527
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:48,180
I think my wife was sad about
our first daughter getting married.

528
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:53,180
She went through a lot
while adopting our eldest.

529
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,350
I ask for your understanding.

530
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,240
No need for that.

531
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,660
So, what did you want to talk about today?

532
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,050
The new director of the
Financial Supervisory Service.

533
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:12,380
Since someone without a financial background
has been appointed, the expectations are high.

534
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:18,930
It's a big deal that someone not indebted to the
financial industry has a job dealing with money.

535
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,020
- But...
- But?

536
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,380
No one lives in this world alone.

537
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,300
Whether we like it or not, we all
end up owing someone something.

538
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,820
I imagine that's the case for him, too.

539
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:38,500
Do you remember what they
used to say in Myeongdong?

540
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,480
- Excuse me?
- During the day, birds listen. At night, rats listen.

541
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,130
If it's about money, Han Woon Jae listens.

542
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,250
Now that I think about it,
you're a lot like your father.

543
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:55,250
I'm not sure. Father didn't even
want me to grow the business.

544
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,930
Aigoo, that scared me.

545
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,700
Look.
[Han Woon Jae]

546
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,910
How did he know I was meeting his son?

547
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,640
Hey, what's going on?

548
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,060
What?

549
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,840
Got it. Bye.

550
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,880
Why would my father call you, Chairwoman?

551
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,420
He's so particular, you know.

552
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,310
He just wanted to say hello or something.

553
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:39,050
Anyway, you mean you would like my help
with Hanwool acquiring Savings Bank, right?

554
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,480
I knew you'd get me, Chairwoman.

555
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,060
Sure.

556
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,340
I'll think about it.

557
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,070
Let's eat.

558
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,900
Yes, Chairwoman.

559
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,540
How long has it been?

560
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,270
Maybe 30 years?

561
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:04,350
We met for the last time in
your office during the IMF.

562
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:11,310
You slapped me in the
face with a wad of cash.

563
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,440
I will never forget that.

564
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,850
It hurt so much.

565
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,680
You reap what you sow.

566
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,950
You collect that much interest.
That's why the wad had to be thick.

567
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,550
- You still hold a grudge against me.
- Of course!

568
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:30,760
How could I like you after all
the money you ripped off of me?

569
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,410
Fine.

570
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,790
Take this and forget about the past.

571
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,670
1.6 billion won.

572
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,580
All the interest I ever took
from you. Every single penny.

573
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:04,710
Han Woon Jae is returning
all the interest? Why?

574
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:11,560
Please take good care of my granddaughter.

575
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,960
She's been through so much.

576
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,550
She was adopted into
that home, knowing nothing.

577
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,630
She's had such a hard life, but...

578
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,350
she doesn't resent anyone.

579
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:31,590
She says she's forgiven everything.

580
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,280
The only thing she's
ever wanted for herself...

581
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,140
This marriage. I want to
make it happen for her.

582
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,880
So, Madam Lee, please accept my Yi Joo...

583
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,880
I don't want this.

584
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,490
- Why are you being like this?
- Look here!

585
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,460
This is my money.

586
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,530
You stole the money I earned
with my blood and sweat.

587
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,780
Now you're showing
off, trying to return it?

588
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,980
Give me a break.

589
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,240
I'm not showing off.
I'm giving it back to you.

590
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,720
I said I don't want it.

591
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,750
The money you touch gets
dirty. I can't even clean it.

592
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:21,230
I'll pretend I never heard
what you said. Goodbye.

593
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,940
Don't do this. How can I...

594
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,620
convey how I feel?

595
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,040
What is wrong with you? What are you doing!

596
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,180
Money is the only way I
know how to speak my heart.

597
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,640
Tell me how. I'll do whatever you want.

598
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,320
My goodness...

599
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,990
I'd rather die than people think I have a love
affair with an old man like you. Get out of my way!

600
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:50,050
- Madam Lee, please!
- You moron!

601
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,850
- Let go, let go!
- Madam Lee, please!

602
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,210
Madam Lee!

603
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,210
Madam Lee!

604
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,490
Damn!

605
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,640
Oh, my.

606
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,750
Where have you been?
Did someone run you dry?

607
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,820
Dry? Yes, someone ran me dry real good.

608
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,290
A scheming grandfather and
a greedy father. Nothing new!

609
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:27,560
Maybe it's a good thing
she's not their bloodline.

610
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,490
What are you talking about?

611
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,460
Hey, look.

612
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,080
You know that girl Han
Yi Joo's number, right?

613
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,010
Why would you need that, Mother?

614
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,690
I need to examine her myself.

615
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,390
I want to know who she is.

616
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,410
Grandpa, what's wrong?

617
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,380
Are you not feeling well?

618
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,380
It's nothing.

619
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,600
I just feel like I'm not being helpful.

620
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,920
What do you mean?

621
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,750
Just a little while ago, thanks to you...

622
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,700
"Thanks to me"? Don't say that.

623
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,190
You know this. Compared to what I owe you,

624
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,010
it was nothing.

625
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:25,360
I need to pay you back properly.

626
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,770
What is it that you owe me?
What is it that you're doing this?

627
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,780
Anyway, don't worry about it.

628
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,610
Grandpa will make your
wedding happen somehow.

629
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:39,710
Yes, thank you, Grandpa.

630
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,710
I'll be back.

631
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,550
Make sure you eat, okay?

632
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,000
I knew it was you.

633
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,340
Why are you following me?

634
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,740
I work for Lee Jung Hye. I
do whatever she tells me to.

635
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,470
No. You're watching me on your own accord.

636
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,700
You saw me meet with my
grandfather last time, too.

637
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,340
But you didn't report to Lee Jung Hye.

638
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,320
So you knew.

639
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,150
Why not?

640
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,800
You work for Lee Jung Hye, Manager Kim.

641
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,270
If Lee Jung Hye is threatened, you
will destroy anyone else in her place.

642
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,640
Tell me.

643
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,460
This behavior, which is unlike you.

644
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,480
How should I interpret that?

645
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,720
Don't decide what "being myself" is for me.

646
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,630
I can change whenever, or however I want.

647
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,630
This is unlike you.

648
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,440
You don't get to decide
what "being myself" is for me.

649
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,090
I can change however I
want, whenever I want.

650
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:19,780
I liked what you said back then.

651
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:26,960
Are you wondering who'll win
between Lee Jung Hye and me or...

652
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,320
trying to figure out who to bet on?

653
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,260
Well...

654
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,960
maybe both?

655
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,370
So, you could be on my team.

656
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,720
Let me make an offer. Be on my team.

657
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,900
I'll pay you anything you want.

658
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,220
I don't need money.

659
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,240
Then what do you need?

660
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,050
I'll think about whose
team I want to be on.

661
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,530
At least while I'm trying to figure it out.

662
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,970
Everyone, be careful. It's hot.

663
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:10,540
And leave it at room
temperature for a moment.

664
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,830
I'll come around and look.

665
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,590
The color should look like this.

666
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,070
No.

667
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:52,760
What's wrong, Cha Yeon Hwa? Why avoid her?

668
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,300
Let me see yours, Yi Joo.

669
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,000
- What do you think, Teacher?
- Well...

670
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,850
how unique.

671
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,650
What do you think? Do you like cooking?

672
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:10,450
It's good when I have a lot on my mind.
I don't have to think about anything else.

673
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,100
Like painting?

674
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,680
I put the painting I got
from you in my room.

675
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,170
I love it so much.

676
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,530
Really?

677
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,270
I'm so glad.

678
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,710
The first painting I ever sold.

679
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,990
You must have painted
for a while to get so skilled.

680
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,000
Since I was little.

681
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,370
There wasn't much else
for me to do at home.

682
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,370
Why does she talk so much like
that instead of trying to kiss up to me?

683
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:45,260
You'll get better at cooking soon, too.

684
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,720
This is done, right?

685
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,270
Yes.

686
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,880
- You'll wrap it up?
- Yes.

687
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,870
- For whom? A boyfriend?
- What?

688
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,880
N-No. I'm going to eat it.

689
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,320
Got it. Wait a minute.

690
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,960
- I'll get you a box.
- Okay.

691
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,000
Mother.

692
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,930
By chance... Is this like...

693
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,540
a piece of art or something?

694
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,850
Art?

695
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,720
It's not that good.

696
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,630
No way. Then, it's just a brownie.

697
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,910
You're clueless, aren't you?

698
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,060
Sorry?

699
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,110
Never mind.

700
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:51,490
You're going to feed this to my son, right?

701
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,170
Cut off the burnt edges.

702
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,740
Maybe sprinkle some sugar powder on top.

703
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,800
As an artist, you really don't
have any decorating instincts.

704
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,820
Gosh, seriously.

705
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,390
Look at you, helping out your
soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

706
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:06,780
Hey!

707
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,140
This is just my duty as a human being.

708
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,610
How can I look at food like
this and not do something, huh?

709
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,120
I know, right?

710
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,220
What's going on? You didn't call.

711
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,530
- I'm hungry.
- What?

712
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,720
I just came to eat. Is there anything?

713
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,310
Wait!

714
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:02,220
Wait right here.

715
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,470
Don't come near. Wait there.

716
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,130
Aigoo!

717
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,860
Whoa...

718
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,040
What is this?

719
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,210
Is it a brick?

720
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,170
I made it.

721
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,850
Han Yi Joo, you did?

722
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,690
Is it a piece of art, then?

723
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,910
Sculpture? Something like that?

724
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:27,120
It's food. It's a brownie.

725
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,450
F-F-Food?

726
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,360
I'll throw it out. Give it to me.

727
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,460
What are you doing?

728
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,290
It might taste good.

729
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,290
Did I break a tooth?

730
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,820
Give it to me.

731
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,870
What are you doing?

732
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,910
I'll make ramen.

733
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,840
You'll have some, right?

734
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,850
Sit down. I'll do it.

735
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:37,590
So, there's nothing wrong for real, right?

736
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:40,060
You didn't even call ahead...

737
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,460
I just wanted to see you.

738
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,780
Okay.

739
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,800
Let's try.

740
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,230
- What are you doing?
- What?

741
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:18,970
Your servant has tasted it for you.

742
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,750
Please have some.

743
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,360
So...

744
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,150
how about your things?

745
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,540
Is that all? You didn't bring much.

746
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,280
I won't be here long anyway.

747
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:15,860
What?

748
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,540
I feel like, especially today...

749
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:25,230
you're so...

750
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,090
drawing a boundary.

751
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,710
- I am.
- What?

752
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:34,740
I don't need to be
acting when it's just us.

753
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,170
This is a fake marriage, after all.

754
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,880
If it doesn't have to
be fake, what happens?

755
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,400
- What?
- What if I wanted a real marriage?

756
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,730
What would you do?

757
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,100
A real marriage?

758
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,100
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean...

759
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,450
when a man talks to a woman like this.

760
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,770
He just met you a few days ago. And
now he's proposing, meeting your family...

761
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:13,120
and having you move in?

762
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,000
The people who know Seo Do Guk would
never believe this. That it's nonsense.

763
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,290
He says he doesn't want to know.

764
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:22,340
Is that something a man in love would say?

765
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,410
That...

766
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,070
can't be.

767
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,840
It can't be?

768
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,330
Why not?

769
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,850
Because I don't have much time.

770
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,970
How much time do you have?

771
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:43,080
For Han Yi Joo, how much...

772
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,290
time is left?

773
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,250
A year.

774
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,540
So, what I mean is...

775
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,080
we signed a year-long contract.

776
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,620
In business, a contract is sacred.

777
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,280
So...

778
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:21,990
please respect...

779
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:25,000
the boundary between us.

780
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,610
Hello?

781
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:06,930
Han Yi Joo?

782
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,620
Yes.

783
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,230
Who is this?

784
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,510
This is Seo Jung Wook,
Do Guk's older brother.

785
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,810
I'm sorry I couldn't come
to the family introduction.

786
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:18,880
I'd like to meet you. Do
you have time tomorrow?

787
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,910
Yes.

788
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,850
That works for me.

789
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,630
How about 9 p.m.?
I'll text you the location.

790
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,660
Oh, right...

791
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,370
I'd prefer that Do Guk
doesn't know about this.

792
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,030
I got it.

793
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,490
All right, then.

794
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,790
Oh, my. Didn't think I'd run into you here.

795
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,940
Is this a coincidence?

796
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,310
No, it's destiny.

797
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,790
You come here when you want to drink alone.

798
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:40,200
Your room is right upstairs.

799
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:45,100
You know a lot about me, it seems.

800
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,580
At least more than my sister, right?

801
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:08,000
I also know a lot more
about men than my sister.

802
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:20,260
I have to go. I have work.

803
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:27,330
Are you so not attracted to me that
you can't even spend a night with me?

804
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,830
Well?

805
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:32,180
More like I don't have feelings for you.

806
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,430
Unni doesn't have feelings for you, either.

807
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:39,170
She only has eyes for Se Hyeok.

808
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:56,670
Did you take this yourself?

809
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,910
Does that matter?

810
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:04,930
What matters is that Se Hyeok has
been going over there without you knowing.

811
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:08,330
You now know what kind
of girl my sister is, right?

812
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:16,930
Right. I see it now.

813
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:20,440
Why you're so obsessed with me.

814
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,820
What?

815
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,150
You just don't want to lose to Han Yi Joo.

816
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,630
She's just a poor orphan with nothing...

817
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:35,570
She can't be better than you...

818
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,620
but you know she shines brighter than you.

819
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:42,780
And you can't handle it.

820
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:46,190
That's why you're
desperate to step all over her.

821
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:49,110
Isn't that how you feel, Han Yoo Ra?

822
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,800
Seo Do Guk, how can you say that?

823
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,120
I'm warning you for the last time.

824
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:12,650
Stop here before you get uglier.

825
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:18,300
I have no intention of
playing your disgusting games.

826

827
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:44,130
Is Yoo Ra home?

828
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,830
Yes. A while ago.

829
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,150
Give it to me. I'll take it to her.

830
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:01,300
Yoo Ra? I'm coming in.

831
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,750

How could you do such a thing?

838
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,490
Don't you know how I raised you?

839
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:43,470
I gave you the best of everything.

840
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:46,070
Everyone was jealous of you!

841
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,760
If you raised me so diligently,

842
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,180
you must be disappointed
I turned out like this.

843
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,550
What?

844
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:01,780
Seo Do Guk told me I'm
not as good as Han Yi Joo.

845
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:05,710
That it's ugly to see me
be so desperate to beat her.

846
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,850
You told me I'm your real child.

847
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:13,490
That Han Yi Joo is just fake.

848
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,680
Then why do I have to hear that?

849
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,840
Seo Do Guk dare say those things?

850
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,860

01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:55,480
Since when do we ask about each other?

868
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,980
I hadn't seen you be
that combative in a while.

869
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,890
I really felt it at the meeting.

870
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:04,050
That this thing was quite important to you.

871
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:05,760
Of course. It's my company.

872
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,270
No, not work.

873
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,820
Your marriage.

874
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,950
- What?
- Isn't that why you came running over?

875
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:15,030
You even got a show of
hands in front of everyone.

876
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:19,800
"Does anyone have a problem
with my marriage? Nope."

877
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,200
I don't know what you mean.

878
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,030
It made me so curious
about your girlfriend.

879
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,600
What kind of person is she?

880
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,480
How would she react if she
knew who Seo Do Guk really was?

881
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,120
What are you scheming?

882
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,570
Well, first of all, she's pretty.

883
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:41,270
- What?
- I wonder what she's like when she's mad.

884
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,680
I think she might look
pretty when she cries.

885
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,080
Where are you right now?

886
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,430
I asked where are you?

887
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:04,370
So, who deposited the funds to Jaeil Group?

888
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,020
It's a business account
in the United Kingdom.

889
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,000
I checked with the international bank

890
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,500
that did the transaction but
can't track the accountholder info.

891
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,810
That means it's a paper
company. Is it Seo Do Guk?

892
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:21,230
I don't see any illegal financial transactions
for Seo Do Guk, personally or professionally.

893
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:23,500
I'll look in other directions.

894
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:28,860
And how about the person
I asked you to look into?

895
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:33,760
Like you said, he seems very
antagonistic toward Seo Do Guk.

896
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,350
Taeja Group's line of
succession may be shifting.

897
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:40,450
Taeja Constructions' VP Seo Jung Wook,
previously discussed as the successor,

898
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:44,650
attempted to exclude H-Terier from the planned
collaboration with the reconstruction project.

899
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,290
Regarding the reason, he...

900
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,930
Maybe...

901
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:51,490
we could talk to him.

902
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:52,960
Right.

903
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:58,630
The most important thing in a
collaboration is sharing the same goal.

904
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:27,900
He said I would recognize him.

905
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,990
Where is he?

906
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,580
Hyung!

907
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,450
Hyung!

908
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,760
Somebody, please help my brother!

909
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,910
Is anyone out there?

910
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,000
Please save him!

911
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,600
Save him!

912
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,140
Is anyone out there?

913
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,420
Hyung!

914
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:19,830
Please save my brother!

915
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:23,580
Please save my brother!

916
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,340
Please save my brother...

917
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:31,830
Please save my brother...

918
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,450
Do Guk?

919
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:49,550
Han Yi Joo.

920
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,900
Where's Seo Jung Wook?

921
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,760
He told me he'd be
here, but I don't see him.

922
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,350
Were you going to meet me with him?

923
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,890
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

924
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:19,640
N-No, I just...

925
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:23,240
I just feel... a little...

926
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,750
a little...

927
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:27,740
Dizzy.

928
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,560
Do Guk! Are you all right?

929
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,430
It's not fair.

930
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,850
What?

931
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,480
You told me not to cross the line...

932
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,570
but you...

933
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:53,470
You just... crossed the... line...

934
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:01,330
Do Guk! Do Guk, wake up!

935
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,260
Do Guk! Do Guk!

936
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,560
Do Guk!

937
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:12,260
What is this, Seo Do Guk? You
were acting like you were fine.

938
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,560
My brother is still the same.

[Perfect Marriage Revenge]

945
01:15:56,530 --> 01:16:00,130
Your marriage is at stake.

946
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:03,240
You kept your life through the loan
games. You want to throw it away now?

947
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,580
Trying to blame me, right?

948
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,020
That's not going to happen.

949
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,690
We'll bet on your older brother.

01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:10,920
It's an important time for
us. Let's focus on one thing.

951
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,100
Making our wedding happen.

952
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,250
Hey! If you mess up with Seo
Do Guk, it's a fraud marriage.

953
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:21,440
I know this illness. The emergency
room can't do anything. I know.
